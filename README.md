# Nightlight
My submission to the GMTK game jam 2022

Game manual:

To move you use the WASD keys and you can use the mouse to change the direction of the torch.
The aim of the game is to last as long as you can against the waves of box headed enemies using the light from your torch as a weapon.
Every so often your torch will flicker out allowing the enemies to attack you, so the game is constantly flicking between you having an advantage and then them.

To play the game open the Nightlight.exe file
